# Very early pyton ChatGPT like application.

This is a preliminary version of a Python-based ChatGPT application intended to operate as a local system instead of a browser-based version. However, it still requires a Wi-Fi connection to access OpenAI's API servers. 

The reason for utilizing OpenAI's API is that it allows for greater flexibility in the types of requests made.

### Why?

Useing openAI's API gives you more freedom in the requests you make.

Cost:

Paying $20 + is wayyyy to much for GPT-4, using the API key you pay per use instead of a fixed amount.

## Requirements.

- OpenAI API key.

- GTK 3.0 must be installed to display the application.

- OpenAI python module.

OpenAI can be installed using pip

```bash
pip install openai
```

### More to come! This is a very early version!

## What is to come?

More features are to come!. 

These features will include:
- local storage of chat logs with the option to encrypt them, 
- specialized features such as writing and editing directly into files. 

You are also invited to make feature requests under "issues," and i will try my best to fulfill them!
