# Very early pyton ChatGPT like application.

It's meant to be a "local" chatGPT instead of a browser version.

Not fully local as you still nead wifi to connect to OpenAI's API servers.

### Why?

Useing openAI's API gives you more freedom in the requests you make.

Cost:

Paying $20 + is wayyyy to much for GPT-4, using the API key you pay per use instead of a fixed amount.

## Requirements.

- OpenAI API key.

It uses GTK 3.0 to display it self, so be sure to have that installed.

```bash
pip install openai
```

### More to come! This is a very early version!
